## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Editor schemas for gojo configuration and theme TOML files, hosted on gojo.rocks
  with autocomplete, documentation, and validation.
- Revert mode (`R` in the log): pick a destination and placement (onto, after,
  or before) to apply the reverse of a commit with `jj revert`.

## [1.10.0] - 2026-09-12

### Added
- AI commit messages using a ChatGPT subscription through Codex CLI with
  `ai_provider = "codex"`. Nix packages and the development shell include Codex.

## [1.9.0] - 2026-09-12

### Added
- Sticky file headers in the diff viewer keep the current filename visible
  while scrolling through long files.

## [1.8.0] - 2026-08-31

### Added
- CLI flags to print the version with `gojo --version` or `gojo -v`, and the
  full changelog with `gojo --changelog`.
- Windows amd64 and arm64 packages installable through Scoop, including the
  required `jj` runtime dependency.

## [1.7.0] - 2026-08-30

### Added
- Workspace management from the log with `w`: list and switch workspaces, add
  workspace directories, rename, forget safely without deleting files, and
  update stale workspaces.
- Workspace ownership labels (`name@`) on working-copy commits in the log and
  revision search.

### Changed
- Typing in the file browser now starts fuzzy search; arrow keys remain
  available for tree navigation without conflicting single-letter shortcuts.
- Diff content appears immediately and gains syntax highlighting
  asynchronously, with faster highlighting for large diffs.
- Updated the terminal runtime for improved input, mouse, focus, and rendering
  compatibility.

### Removed
- x86_64 Darwin support from the Nix flake; supported Darwin builds are arm64.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-08-09

### Added
- Arch Linux pacman packages (`.pkg.tar.zst`) attached to each GitHub
  release, depending on the distro `jujutsu` package.
- Debian/Ubuntu packages (`.deb`) attached to each GitHub release, with
  `jujutsu` as a recommended dependency.
- Fedora/RHEL packages (`.rpm`) attached to each GitHub release, with
  `jujutsu` as a weak recommendation (also usable on openSUSE).
- openSUSE installation support via the same release `.rpm` (zypper).
- `nix run .#bump -- [major|minor|patch|X.Y.Z]` helper: writes VERSION and
  refreshes the flake vendorHash.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-06-29

First tagged release.

### Added
- Fullscreen terminal UI for jj: scrollable commit graph with change IDs,
  authors, dates, bookmarks, and working-copy highlighting.
- Diff panel with file status summary and chroma syntax highlighting.
- File browser with blame annotation and history navigation.
- Bookmark management (create, delete, move, rename, set, track, untrack).
- Git integration: fetch, push, and remote management from within the TUI.
- AI-generated commit descriptions via OpenRouter.
- Undo / redo, squash mode, and context-aware help bar.
- Native jj graph rendering with styled nodes and edges.
- TOML config at `~/.config/gojo/gojo.toml` (or `[tools.gojo]` in jj config).
- Nix flake (devShell + package), Homebrew formula, and release automation.
